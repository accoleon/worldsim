\chapter*{Parallel Plan}

The GWS design includes several places to introduce and explore parallelism.

\begin{description}
\item[Task Parallelism] The core simulation is run by the various Systems which can all be run in parallel, and shared data can be managed either through a rudimentary message passing mechanism or careful design to minimize shared data.
\item[Data Parallelism] All entities are made up of components which are stored in contiguous vectors which will enable vectorization of the code (instruction-level parallelism) and the use of elemental functions across components.
\end{description}

We plan to look at system scaling by varying the number of initial objects in the simulation and the number of systems available. We intend to look at wall clock time to complete a fixed number of simulation steps.
