\chapter*{Project Description}
Genetic World Simulator (GWS) is an expansion of Conway's Game of Life simulation by exploring theoretical alien ecology through a 2D simulation. The simulator hosts several Systems such as Weather, Growth, Mutation, Predation, Movement, and Rendering. The Systems will simulate the world based on clock-ticks and we will explore the possibilities of various alien characteristics and how it will affect the ecological system in the world. The default output will be a 2D visualization in real-time.

The clock tick rate will be user-definable, in order to speed up or slow down the rate of simulation. The user will also be able to see the growth of the ecosystem and how it will interact with the weather systems in real time. There will possibly be a "multilayer" plane that will show the ground level, "weather" level, and "growth" level (2D plot of characteristics such as growth rate, reproduction rate, etc).

The world simulator will host the various systems in the world, and will produce 2D graphical output to be viewed locally, or remotely as a stream of data (and accelerated possibly using WebGL). In the local console, we will explore using OpenGL or an abstracted graphical framework to product the output.
