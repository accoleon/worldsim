\chapter*{Executive Summary}
The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (OSNAP) has made a substantial investment to research alien ecological systems. The Genetic World Simulator (GWS) is an attempt to simulate an alien world with various parameters in order to discover the potential weaknesses, patterns, and systems in alien biology and ecology.

GWS simulates a flat-state world with various physical features (water level, oxygen level, heat level) and alien organisms (entities with various characteristics such as growth rate, mutation rate, offensive and defensive mechanisms) to reveal underlying patterns of alien ecology and to discover the potential growth of any alien organisms in a predetermined environment.
